# add-pr-comment-proxy

A simple proxy for PR comments. Works well with [add-pr-comment](https://github.com/mshick/add-pr-comment/). Workaround for GitHub making all token permissions read-only when a fork is submitted for a PR. See [this discussion](https://github.community/t/github-actions-are-severely-limited-on-prs/18179/4) for more detail.

## Deploy

**Requirements**

- A [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `repo:public_repos` scope if you're using this to support a public repo. Your use-case might require other scopes.

**Run on Cloud Run**

## How it works

This app is a thin Node.js proxy around the [create an issue comment](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment) GitHub endpoint that allows you to send requests with a GitHub Action's [temporary token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret) and create issue comments. It verifies that your request has a valid temporary token, but it's difficult to ensure any more than that. A shared secret cannot be used as GitHub will strip it when the fork's Actions run.

## Vercel Deployment Notes

### About the `.vercel` Folder
The `.vercel` folder is automatically created when you link your project directory to a Vercel project. This folder should not be committed to your repository - it contains local deployment information like project and organization IDs.

**Important:** Add `.vercel` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing it.
